Toll-like receptors:

Two defences towards bacteria and viruses:
  1) Innate immune system
  2) Adaptive immune system (in vertebrate animals)  
    - Comes in if problem more severe, w/ custom antibodies and lots of white
      blood cells. 

Innate system battles common foes -- TOLL PROTEIN: bacterial and fungal
infections.

Our cells contain 10 Toll-like receptors. 

Toll-like receptors activate an inflammatory response which fights pathogens.
E.g. mice with faulty TLRs die quickly due to bacterial infections and the
likes. 

TLRs send signals by forming a dimer. 
DIMER: A molecule or molecular complex consisting of two identical
molecules linked together.

Pathegenic molecules bring together cytoplasmic domains of the TLR (outside of
the cell), initiating a cascade of signals (inside of the cell).
