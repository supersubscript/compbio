\section{Regulation of the CLV3 domain induces periodicity when perturbed}
When tracking the number of CLV3 nuclei identified by Costanza, the results
observable in \cref{fig:clv3_trajs} shows the number of observed CLV3 nuclei
increasing for plants 2, 4, 13, and 15, corresponding to a visually observable
enlargement of the CLV3 domain analogous to the one seen in
\cref{fig:visual_osc}. The fluctuations do not significantly correlate with the
mean intensity level except for plant 15 ($p = 0.99, 0.36, 0.76, 0.01$), and
thus generally correspond to a pulsating enlargement of the domain as opposed to
fluctuations in the CLV3 intensity.

    an increase in the number of nuclei over time, and appear to dip in a
    systematic manner. The mean intensity occasionally shifts in accordance with
    the number of CLV3 nuclei, but in a non-systematic manner.}

\end{figure}

In order to assess the extent of the fluctuations the lines were detrended using
a second order Loess fit to each curve, producing the curves found in
\cref{fig:detrended}. When thereafter performing a continuous time
Fourier transform to extract amplified modes, we see that the plants are
biased towards the fourth mode, i.e.\ a period of $\sim$16~hours, in each
respective transformation, as depicted in  
\cref{fig:periodogram}.

\vspace{2em}
In addition to the apparent periodicity, the number of division events
correlates strongly with the number of active CLV3 nuclei when normalised by the
total number of cells observed, howing that the number of division scales with
the size of the CLV3 domain.


\section{CLV3 expression is stable for apical cells}
Variance in the expression of CLV3 is suppressed in the apical cells, as can be
seen in \cref{fig:clv3d2t}. Generally, the CLV3 distribution assumes a
shape with low variance close to the apex, larger variance at intermediate
distances, and again low variance at larger distances. 
This appears true for all plants, although plant
13 in particular shows tendencies of having a few lowly expressing apical cells at
several timepoints. It should however be noted that it is possible that errors
in the tracking produces this type of data. 

Closer investigations in the distribution of expression
values at distinct distances shows non-bimodal tendencies. Instead, the data
suggests an apparent CLV3 gradient, proportional to the distance to the apex
more in radial terms than in bimodal ones.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{clv3_vs_d2t.pdf}
  \caption[CLV3 distributions]{CLV3 expression distributions for the L1, with the apex of the
    meristem defined as the mean coordinates of the 4 topmost expressing cells
    at each given timepoint. The distributions all assume a hysteresis-like
    appearance, with minor variance at the apex, a highly variable body, and a
    yet again lowly variable tail.}
  \label{fig:clv3d2t}
\end{figure}

Using a simple model mimicking the epidermis, we are possible to
replicate the shape of the distribution assuming enzymatic CLV3 activation by a WUS gradient
(\cref{fig:model1}). The enzymatic activation is in this formulation necessary in order to
attain the sigmoidal shape of the curve.

  \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{model1_results.pdf}
  \caption[Epidermis model]{Epidermis model recreating the results observed in
    \cref{fig:clv3d2t}. Here, a gradient of WUS induces sufficient
    activating mechanics for producing the correct CLV3 gradient.}
  \label{fig:model1}
\end{figure}

Aside of the CLV3 distribution in the L1, we observe a layer-wise separation of
the CLV3 expression in the comparison between
L1 and L2, as visualised in \cref{fig:epireg}. In L1, the correlation between
CLV3 expression and nuclear volume appears sigmoidal, although consideration
should be taken to the fluorescence ceiling due to the laser. In contrast, both
L2 and L3 have linear relationships, indicating the possibility of epidermal
activation alternatively subepidermal repression altering the distributions.
Also in the distributions of CLV3 expression in relation to the distance to the
apex this effect is observable.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{epireg.pdf}
  \caption[Cues of epidermal regulation]{Distribution data suggest differing
    regulation between L1 and the subepidermal layers. In penetrating deeper
    into the tissue, the CLV3 expression relative the nuclear volume changes
    from a sigmoidal to linear relationship (left). Similarly, the CLV3
    expression relative the distance to the apex appears to have similar shape
    in the L2 as in the L1,
    but shifted.}
  \label{fig:epireg}
\end{figure}

 \section{Functional clustering implies dsRED technical artefacts}
 The apical cells appear to be clustered functionally, suggesting that a
 significant portion of the CLV3 expression observed outside of these topmost
 cells may in fact be reporter remnants, steming from the decay time of the
 dsRED reporter. 
 
 \Cref{fig:mvol_apex} shows a tendency of the apical cells to
 assume a differing average membrane volume between cells at the apex (distance
 0), and the
 ones neighbouring (p = $5e-12, 1e-2, 7e-4, 7e-5$). This
 contrasts with the observed nuclear volume, where instead an overall decreasing
 trend in the response to CLV3 appears, as \cref{fig:nvol_apex} depicts.)
 
 In addition, the topmost cells undergo significantly fewer divisions per cell in
 that region as opposed to the other cells in the L1 (\cref{fig:nDivs_apex}).
 Most division events instead appear to be focused in the first to third cell
 layer away from the apex, and thereafter decline. Under the assumption that the
 number of cells scale with the area such that $N \propto r^2$, we should expect
 to see the number of division events increase linearly with $r$; here we
 instead see the linear tendency only for cell distances 1-3, where the topmost cells
 behave differently. Generally, the observations can be observed in three
 points:
 \begin{enumerate}
   \item Topmost cells divide less frequently than cells in layer 1-3
   \item Cells in layers 1-3 divide at a similar frequency per cell
   \item At cell distances $>3$, the number of divisions per cell decreases
     steadily
 \end{enumerate}

     topmost expressing cells; their neighbours in turn correspond to the cells
     at distance 1, and so on. Here all examples but plant 2 have a
     statistically significant separation of average membrane sizes between bin
     0 and bin 1.}

     distance, along with the standard error of the mean. As in the membrane

     than the other plants and in particular exhibits a larger variance,
     showing noise in the definition of the topmost cells. 
   }  
   \label{fig:nDivs_apex}
\end{figure}

Separating out the lineages which are present throughout the full time course
reveals an apparent contained maintenance of ca four cells where decline in the
CLV3 expression can not be noted (\cref{fig:trajectories}; lineages 7, 16,
17). Overall, cells appear to be in either one of two state with respect to
the rate of change of their CLV3 expression, in a few select trajectories, where
further analysis indicates that cells  
assume a declining state when pushed out of the very apex. Cells that in
contrast remain in this region maintain their high expression profiles,
signifying the possibility of only the very apical cells effectively expressing
CLV3. 

It is unclear whether the resolution of the trajectories is significant
enough to observe the exponential decay in dsRED, or whether a linear
approximation is sufficient. \Cref{fig:dsred_decay} shows these two alternatives
where the interpretation of the half-life differs with a factor of two depending
on the interpretation, where the exponential one corresponds to a half-life of
roughly 41.7 hours, and the linear correspondingly 83.3 hours, assuming a Taylor
expansion to the first order.

      emphasised in the bottom right. This corresponds in to the behaviour
      illustrated in the bottom left, with cell lineages at the very top having
      preserved expression levels, and with decreasing signal outside outside of
      this region. Lacking timepoints in trajectories in most cases correspond
      to data filtered out due to division events (see \cref{sec:filtering}).}

    Fitted lines are taken as the mean coefficients of singular fits to each
    individual line, presented with the 95~\% confidence interval.
    Also plants 4, 13 and 15 produce results within the margin of errors for
    both approximations.
  }
  \label{fig:dsred_decay}
\end{figure}

Assuming a situation where dsRED is not produced, we can hypothesise of the
formulation of at what rate CLV3 decays with the distance to the apex. Given
that cells are on average pushed out of the CZ at a rate $\dot R = k_R$, the
rate of change for the CLV3 expression can be written on the form 
\begin{align*}
  \dot C = \frac{\dd C}{\dd t} &= \frac{\dd C}{\dd R} \frac{\dd R}{\dd t}
  \Rightarrow \\
  \frac{\dd C}{\dd R} &= \frac{1}{k_R} \frac{\dd C}{\dd t} 
  \label{eq:decayrate}
\end{align*}
where $R$ denotes the radial distance. Under linear CLV3 decay, e.g.\ $\dot C =
-k_{C}$, CLV3 should decay linearly with the radius as $\frac{\dd C}{\dd R} =
\frac{k_{C}}{k_{R}}$, which appears possible given the distribution in
\cref{fig:clv3d2t}.

\section{Long-lived cells are amassed centrally in the deep tissue}
A clear cluster of cells are clustered at an age corresponding to roughly
$3\times$ the normal cell cycle in the deeper layers. Notably, this effect is
not accompanied by a similar cluster at $2\times$ the normal cell length, which
would be expected in the event of missed divisions in the tracking. The effect
is the most noticeable in plants 2, 4, and 15, where all of these show an
amassment of division events at the 60 hour mark, most protruding in the L3.

    and 18, and how cells in the boundary between primordia tend to be

  \label{fig:age_clusters}
\end{figure}
Notably, the CLV3 peak and the geometric apex does typically not coincide, with
the CLV3-based apex typically at a distance of $10-20\mu$m, corresponding to 2-4
cells in distance. While the quality of the fit can be affected by the presence
of primordia, the evolution of paraboloid parameters over time is relatively
constant, as can be see in \cref{fig:para_time}.

\end{figure}

For emphasis, we have included an example of the evolution of the largest axis
of curvature for plant 15 (\cref{fig:timeevol_ex}). In general, the paraboloid
shape does not vary greatly between timepoints, demonstrating the reliability in
the defintion of the geometric apex.

    \cref{fig:para_time}. One significant outlier can be seen, corresponding to
    $t = 48$ hours; other parabola have curvatures similar in magnitude.}
