\section{NPA dilution induces a periodic response}
% NPA is diluted -- oscillations
It is likely that the state transition that appears in \cref{fig:clv3_trajs} are
caused by the slight dilution of NPA that occurs during imaging. Hypothetically,
was NPA is diluted, auxin transport would incrementally be restored in the plant
and cause initiation of primordia. In support of this, the fact that the
observed cyclicity appears to  
happen in a $\sim$16 hour interval suggests that the fluctuations are not
primarily driven by the circadian clock, which could otherwise be a cause of the
periodicity. Since it is well-known that the network regulating
the niche at the SAM consists of multiple feedback loops, it is
possible that these are what causes the oscillatory tendencies as the
plants trends towards the new steady state induced by the NPA dilution.

% CLV3-WUS creating oscillations?
While some of the variations between plants can be attributed to biological
differences, the overall tendency of the four plants in their behaviour over
time indicate a biochemical response to the NPA dilution in a periodic manner. A
possible direct pathway for this type of effect could be through the direct WUS
or CLV1/CLV3 interaction of NPA, although more likely is downstream factors
being influenced by the initialisation of auxin patterns. Nevertheless, a
feedback motif responding to the system perturbations would be precisely the
type of mechanism which would be expected to drive a periodic response.

% Possible mechanism driving increased oscillations
That the fluctuations have an increasing amplitude as time progresses can be
explained by the iterative dilution of NPA, and a resulting avalanche effect,
where more auxin present in the cells effectively reduce the
electric repulsion induced by the former. That auxin transport is indeed being
restored is emphasised by multiple plants beginning to form primordia throughout
the timecourse, as exemplified in \cref{fig:NPA_primordia}.

% Number of divisions increase
As the number of division events correlates clearly with the number of nuclei
identified, the perturbations in the system seem structural in the sense that
the stem cell niche grows not only in size, but also in what number of cells
actively proliferate. As the plant grows, we are therefore observing not only a
larger number of cells in general, but also a larger number of cells that are
part of the effective stem cell niche.

\section{Distributional cues hints at possible regulatory mechanisms}
% WUS activating CLV3
The regulation of noise at the SAM is explained by our simple activating model,
where the upregulation of CLV3 by WUS is sufficient to produce the
hysteresis-like features of the distribution. The reason for this is explained
by production saturation at the apex when CLV3 levels are already high, and the
highest activating concentration being present in this region, such that when
CLV3 experiences a minor stochastic degradation event, the activating signal
quickly overcomes this downgrading and resets the high expression in the apical
cells. Technically, with our configurations used herein, our GRN creates a
bistability in the system, where the saturation of the CLV3 activating agent
causes high amounts of noise at intermediate distances from the apex. Because of
this, the enzymatic activation is sufficient to produce the CLV3 distribution.
In the peripheral tissue, WUS is simply not abundant enough for producing a
high CLV3 concentration, which also results in a lower tail variance. 

While our simple model is suffient to explain the type of distribution in the
epidermis, the apparent scaling in values due to deeper penetration in the
tissue suggests a mechanism for repressing CLV3 expression in this region. While
both direct repression and repression of an activator such as WUS are
possible regulatory causes, previous research has suggested epidermal
signalling as a possible mechanism to scaling the stem cell niche. In addition, the
distribution differences between the epidermis and the subepidermal layers with
respect to the relationship between nuclear volume and CLV3 expression indicate
differing regulation between the layers, as we otherwise would expect to see the
same types of distributions, albeit scaled. Lastly, as the number of divisions seem to
quickly decline in cells beyond the fourth cell from the apex, it possible that cells at that
point are entering a regime which is under the influence of differentiation
inducing signals, making them less prone to proliferate. In support of this, the
average membrane size per layer does not vary significantly, suggesting that
molecular signals, rather than growth and size related ones, are what gives
rise to the observed effect.

\section{\textit{In vivo} tracking sheds light on steady regulation of the true stem
  cell niche}
The behavioural discrepancy between the topmost cells and their
neighbours suggests a phenotypic separation between the roughly four highest
expressing cells and their neighbours. The fact
that plant 2 disagrees  might be due to the
absolute definition of which cells are the topmost ones, i.e.\ four in our
configuration. It is possible that plant 2 simply maintains a differently sized
stem cell niche, or is generally more variable in its expression levels, which
would introduce significantly more noise in the measure and explain the lack of
observed clusters.  

The \textit{in vivo} tracking of lineages in the L1 reveals insight into the
maintenance of CLV3 expression at the top. A select few cells are clearly
subject to highly regulated CLV3 expression values, whereas the cells outside of
this regime appear to be steadily degraded. The repeated signs of the apical
cells being special with respect to their phenotype does however suggest that
a significant portion of the observed CLV3 expression in fact stems from the
long half-life of dsRED, which is known to be able to last for extended periods
on the order of magnitude of several days. Our analysis allows us to better
approximate the extent of the factual CLV3  
domain, as we through our analysis can account for the degradation time of dsRED.
While our approximation of the reporter half-life is approximate and hampered by
the lack of complete data, it shows promise for extended analyses of how dsRED
is degraded within the living tissue. 

%Might be a good place to discuss errors and why we don't see stem cells in L2.

\subsection{Longevity could be induced by the WUS domain}
The observed cluster of cells surviving for extended periods of time could most
easily be explained by tracking errors and failure to identify a division event,
which would cause an amassment of cells living for multiples of the average cell
cycle length. However, this type of effect would in principle cause an peak in
the division age density also at roughly the 40 hour mark, which we do not see
in \cref{fig:age}. The only clusters seen are instead emphasised around the
$~20$ and $~60$ hour mark, with a slight downwards shift for $L2$ and $L3+$ due
to cells being lost in the tracking reappearing as newly cells in the analysis.

In addition, the longevity cells appear to be clustered to regions close to the
center of the meristem, as depicted in \cref{fig:age_clusters}. A causation of this
could be an influencing factor in the OZ, e.g.\ WUS, which significantly
represses proliferation. 

A possible factor affecting the results could be the penetretion depth of the
laser in the deeper tissue, which due to the paraboloid-like shape of the
meristem could cause errors in tracking. Nevertheless, this would not explain
the lack of peaks at the $\sim$40 hour mark. 

% Spatial cues from division data
\subsection{Non-centric CLV3 apex for directed development}
That the CLV3 peaks typically tend to be shifted slightly from the geometric
apex could have a role in directing growth in phyllotaxis. The fact that we
can note a seemingly normal distribution of distances for the CLV3 peaks might
indicate that the CLV3 peak rotates slightly around the geometric center over
time, in order to specify the direction of growth for organ primordia, which in
AT are initiated sequentially in a spiral-like structure. 
It is also possible that we see under correct angles would be able to see a
slight wiggling over the apex over time, although the lack of control of the
angle in which the plants were imaged makess this analysis difficult.
