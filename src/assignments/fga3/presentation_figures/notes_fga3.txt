Conserved
GEO 		mostly involved with metabolic/catabolic processes, cell cycle, transport
Pathways 	cell cycle (mitotic), metabolism, transport

Non-conserved
GEO 		heart development?! 40-fold; regulation of signalling and metabolic/catabolic proc. 	
Pathways 	RHO GPTpase cycle, G alpha signalling events, Notch pathway


RHOA expression levels correlated positively with the progression of the disease

DEXSeq for non-conserved genes: show enrichment in RHO GPTase-related things.

Genes which are driven by progesterone AND change their allegiance when you add it
- Are there any interesting isoforms here which might be direct targets of progesterone?
- In this subset of genes, we have differential splicing of the PISD gene, which is involved
	in the FOXA1 transcription factor pathway. 
- Sadly, it looks like PISD is downstream of this...

Progesterone receptor is 2.5-fold expressed in T47D genes than in MCF7, both in control and progesterone comparison. 

Reading through the literature and compiling a list of ER-a and PR co-activator / co-factor / co-chaperone / chaperone genes (and ERG1), show that almost all of them (7/9) are differentially expressed between the samples in the control setting (and all when you add progesterone).

Doing a splicing analysis of these show that FKBP has differential exon usage between the cell lines, but hardly any reliable amounts in order to account for any change.
