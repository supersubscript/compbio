\section{Experimental procedure} 
The Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) marker for the plasma membrane was
amplified using PCR with primers attb1-mYfwd
(5'-AGAAAGCTGGGTTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGAGAGTG) and attb2-YFPrev
(5'-AGAAAGCTGGGTTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGAGAGTG), with the forward primer
sequence containing a motif known to acetylate in plant cells~CITEHERE. 50
$\mu$L solution was amplified in 96 $^\circ$C for 1 minute, followed by 25
cycles of 96 $^\circ$C for 30 seconds, and a final elongation for 30 seconds. 5
$\mu$L of the result was then used in a second reaction consisting of
40~$\mu$L solution in total, with primers B1 adapt (5'-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCT)
and B2 adapt (5'-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGT) included. Similar to the first
solution, the second mixture was amplified by PCR in 95 $^\circ$C for 2 minutes,
followed by 94 $^\circ$C for 30 seconds, 48 $^\circ$C for 30 seconds, and 72
$^\circ$C for 1 minute, 20 cycles of 94 $^\circ$C for 30 seconds,
55 $^\circ$C for 30 seconds, and 72 $^\circ$C for 1 minute. Finally, elongation
took place under 72 $^\circ$C for 1 minute.
