How many neurons does the human brain have? How many connections?
  10^11 neurons. Every neuron has 1-1000 connections.

What are the parts of the neuron?
  Dendritic tree, cell body, axon, axon terminal, synapses

How does the neuron transmit signals?
  When cell reaches threshold, spike travels along axon. All or nothing event.

Describe a synaptic cleft
  presyn. neuron, postsyn neuron, vesicles, neurotransmitters, receptor
  gap junction!

Describe how the neuron builds up voltage. Draw a curve. for how this looks like and why.
  By ion channels. Some voltage gated. 10^2-10^6 channels per mikron^2.
  Each channel ca. 10 nm high. 
  Na+, K+ important. Selective transport. E_Na = 50 mV, E_K = -77 mV.

How does myelin impact the propagation of the action potential? Draw figure.
  It insulates part of the axon such that the resistance is lowered(?). The
  signal then travels faster than when unmyelinated.

Explain roughly how a membrane ion gate works
  Selectivity filter, sensor, pore, anchor protein

What is tau_n in the neuron equations? 
  1 / (alpha + beta), i.e. the inverse of the total flow.

Describe Hodgkin-Huxley's equations.
  c_m dVdt = -i_m + I_e/A
  Each ion:
    i_m = sum(g_i[gating](V-E_i))
    c_m dVdt = g_L(E_L - V) + g_Na m**3 h (E_Na-V) + g_K n**4 (E_K-V) + I_e/A
    Plus equations for the other (gating) variables.

Describe the parameters in common neuroscience equations
  See slides
  
Describe some simplifications to HH
  1. tau_m small. Eliminate dmdt.
  2. tau_h approximately tau_n. Eliminate dhdt

Describe FitzHugh-Nagumo's system
  Membrane voltage + recovery variable
  * Write down equations

Explain Hopf bifurcation analysis
  Stable, supercritical, subcritical, oscillating, etc.

Explain van der Pol eqautions
  vdP a non-conservative oscillator with non-linear damping.

What are integrate and fire models?
  We're just interested in the spikes.
  I.e. When do we reach the threshold level? Then reset. 

What are some features of ion channels?
  They are stochastic
  When many are open, the noise decreases.
  Na channels have feedback loops. 

Talk about modelling synaptic inputs
  Stochastic release of vesicles
  Postsynaptic conductance
  Reversal potential of synapse

Talk about postsynaptic / presynaptic release

What are some feature differences between excitatory and inhibitory neurons?
  Synchrony. Inhibitory neurons tend to fire in sync, whereas excitatory often
  fail to do so unless they start out identical.

Name a few networks for long and short term memory storage
  Long: Hopfield
  Short: Phase plane analysis of small networks; Wilson Cowan nets

Why are firing rates more interesting than spike trains?
  More profound -- more analysis
  Computationally more tractable
  Often fewer parameters
  Can represent average of many neurons in one chunk

Describe associative memories
  Content addressable -- retrieve all from part
  cf. direct access -- know location to find content

What are auto- and heteroassociation?
  Given x -- recall x
  Given x -- recall y

What are benefits / drawbacks of asynchronous update?
  Select at random: Gibbs sampling
  Poorly defined.
  Will converge.

Talk about the energy function
  Describes trail to minimum
  Each minima -- stable state (stored pattern)
  Energy monotonically decreases

Prove that E is always minimised
  
Describe how to solve the TSP using hopfield nets

What are some problems Hopfield; how to solve them?
  Inverse stable. Sign bit.
  Mixture states. Mix of patterns.
  Spin glass states. Not related to anything.

What is a Boltzmann machine? 
  Go to stochastic regime.
  Update rule: P(v_i =1) = f(a_i)
  f(a_i) = 1 / (1 + exp(-a_i))

Explain general stability analysis

Explain P-B and Hopf
  PB: Suppose annulus, 1) containing no equilibrium points. 2) All trajectories that
  cross boundary enter it. Then: E1 asymptotically stable limit cycle. If there
  is a trapping region inside, ensure unstable repellor and make hole around it.
  Hopf: Supercritical (stable limit cycle), subcritical (unstable limit cycle)
  Do numerical analysis around critical value alpha to ensure type.

Wilson and Cowan networks
  Assume conditions for spatially uniform steady states to be unstable.
  1. Short term memory
  2. Spatially localized oscillations.
  3. Travelling waves leading to visual hallucinations.

Lecture 6 -- supervised learning
-------------------------
Explain difference between the three types of learning
  Supervised: "I know how to classify this data, I just need you(the classifier) 
    to sort it."  
  Unsupervised: "I have no idea how to classify this data, can you (the 
    algorithm) create a classifier for me?"      
  Reinforcement: "I have no idea how to classify this data, can you classify 
    this data and I'll give you a reward if it's correct or I'll punish you if it's not."        

Briefly introduce the perceptron
  Binary input units
  Various transfer functions depending on the desired outcome.
  Defines a hyperplane in N-D space. Can solve linearly separable problems.

How would you implement a bias unit? 
  Always one. Update weights as ordinary. Compare output with 0.

What is the perceptron convergence theorem?
  If there are two ideal weights separating two classes, the perceptron rule
  will find them.

What are some modifications you can make to improve learning?
  Weight decay 
  Momentum
  Prevents overfitting.
