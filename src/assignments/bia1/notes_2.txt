Change lookup table: 3-3-2 RGB
Gaussian blur -- remove noise? 

Trackmate has filtering built-in. Won't have to threhold. 

Run trackmate
* LoG 5-20 pixels 
  Estimate 15-20, median filter
  Don't threshold here

* Skip inital thresholding here as well

* Hyperstack display-viewer
  Quality, set that, play around.

* Set spot filter optional? Signal/Noise ratio? 

* LAP Tracker (not simple) 
  No frame-frame linkage (how to disable?) 
  Hen: Set x/y/z penalty?
  Do track segment splitting
  Play around with params


(Set filter for start/stop time. Only want to keep track of things there
throughout. Ignore tracks outside of the frame (cells that leave at any point).
Set filters on edges? Hacky. Exclude all that fall within one of these groups.)
NEW IDEA: Filter out tracks which which change in number from the exported data. 

Plot N spots vs time -- answer to Q1. 

Q?--: Export all spots statistics
Can answer most of the rest of the Qs once everything is filtered correctly.

Final thing: Automation. 
Save file with tracking data. Website for trackmate has a script which reads
trackmate file and reproduces results. (Enough?)'
There is also a plugin which makes macro recording work in TrackMate.


Limitations: 
  Not all cells recognized.
  Some cells disappear and emerge again.
  A couple of cells join each other (from two separate tracks), joining into
    one, but when they re-emerge, they will be part of the same track, even though
    no cell division has happened. 
  

Notes: 
  Number of division events = (number of cells after - number of cells before) - 1
  "Get rid of everything that starts at 0"
  
  Procedure:
    1. Set gaussian blur, 1 mikro-m
    2. Ramp up contrast (max it), and add a little brightness
    3. TrackMate: 15 mikro-m, median filter.
    4. Thresholding
    5. Set filter on cell quality
    5. Set splitting. 15 mikro-m. 
        - Don't change other params?
