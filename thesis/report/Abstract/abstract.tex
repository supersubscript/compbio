  Understanding plant development has implications for fields as wide-ranging as
  crop yield improvement and regenerative medicine. Aerial development in the
  plant is driven primarily by the developing center known as the shoot apical
  meristem (SAM), at the central zone (CZ) of which a small collection of stem
  cells reside and divide in order to produce cells for regeneration of tissue
  and new organ formation. The stem cells at the apex express the the CLAVATA-3
  (CLV3) gene, making the expression of which a direct identifier of the stem cell
  phenotype. Modern imaging tools and segmentation software have recently
  enabled extensive capabilities to both accurately measure cells in the SAM, as
  well as to follow their dynamics over time. In this thesis, we show how a
  small ``true'' stem cell niche is maintained in the SAM over time, and that
  the center of this region is not located at the geometric apex, possibly for
  phyllotactic priming. We also point at possible regulatory means for the SAM
  to maintain robustness in expression for the apical cells.


%  The shoot apical meristem (SAM) is a collection of stem cells that resides at
%  the tip of each shoot and provides the cells of the shoot. It is divided into
%  functional regions. The central zone (CZ) at the tip of the meristem is the
%  domain of expression of the CLAVATA3 (CLV3) gene, encoding a putative ligand
%  for a transmembrane receptor kinase, CLAVATA1, active in cells of the rib
%  meristem (RM), located just below the CZ. We show here that CLV3 restricts its
%  own domain of expression (the CZ) by preventing differentiation of peripheral
%  zone cells (PZ), which surround the CZ, into CZ cells and restricts overall
%  SAM size by a separate, long-range effect on cell division rate.
