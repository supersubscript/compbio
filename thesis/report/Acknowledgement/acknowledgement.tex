\begin{acknowledgements}
  This thesis is the product not only of my own efforts, but by all the people
  that in their own ways have stumbled across my path. That being said, I am
  extremely grateful for the immense support I have received from my supervisor
  José Teles, who unwaveringly was available for all situations both social and
  academic. I have been incredibly well received by the whole of
  the Jönsson group at SLCU in general, with a particular mention to Henrik Jönsson, Jérémy
  Gruel and Yassin Refahi, who all assisted me directly in work relating to this thesis
  -- thank you. A certain regard goes out to my office colleagues Julia
  Deichmann, Rémy Naylor, and Max Brambach, the last without whose assistance
  parts of this thesis would not be. 

  From my MPhil cohort, I would not have been able to have such a good time
  throughout the year without my very good friends in Bash Gordon -- I\~nigo
  Ayestaran and Ramya Rangan. I wish you both all the best to come.
  
  Lastly, without the support of Klara Berg in all things high and low, I would
  likely be tearing my hair a whole lot more than I already am at this point. Thank
  you for always being there.

  Oh, and thank you, Julian Melgar -- thank you!
