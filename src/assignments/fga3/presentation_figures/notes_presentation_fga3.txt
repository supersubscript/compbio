Introduction
================================
Role of progesterone in er-a positive breast cancer

Progesterone is a hormone 

Addition of progesterone induces a global increase in ER-a binding to the genome, co-located with PR and p300, which is a co-activator of ER-a. Together, these create an active transcription regulatory complex which alters the gene expression signature of the cancer. 

Differential binding maps to differential expression of genes; genes which are mapped in this manner are associated with better survival prognosis. 

================================
RNA-seq processing steps
================================
Raw reads, remove adapters with cutadapt

Alignment with TopHat, Ensembl reference genome GRCh37

Merge technical replicates

Deduplication of duplicate reads

Mapped read counts to genomic features using htseq-count

================================
Debugging RNA alignments
================================
Strandedness -- we map alignments to both sense and antisense strands.

Still some differences, which might be explained by different TopHat versions and using another version of htseq-counts. 

================================
Differential expression of RNA-seq
================================

We get a set of genes which are regulated by BOTH progesterone and R5020. These cluster between the samples nicely. 

MCF7, the reaction to addition of progesterone is not as clear.  

================================
Differential expression of RNA-seq 2
================================

Lots of genes differentially expressed in T47D under both conditions. MCF7 more restrictive in its response. 

Also, R5020 creates a bigger response than progesterone in both cell lines, though marginally so. 

Again, our results are significantly smaller, but the paper doesn't mention all that much about their methodology; we just had to assume. What's more, the paper mentions a significance level of 0.01, but the scripts they used say 0.05.  

================================
Metabric
================================

METABRIC -- same data set we used for FG2

Supposed to be the same as in the paper, but we can't find several of the genes that are in the paper's gene signature. 

Switched data set, METABRIC not easily available

================================
Kaplan-Meier
================================
Determine clinical significance of gene list:

Paper, nice separation.

NKI + paper genes: nice separation between top and bottom 5 percent according to fit to gene signature


================================
SIGCHECK
================================
Their genes are better than random

Our genes are shit

================================
CONCLUSION
================================

Just read slide

================================
================================
================================
INDIVIDUAL PART
================================
================================
================================
See from RNA-seq data that the differences between cell lines are bigger than differences between the treated / untreated conditions.

MCF7 has a copy number loss of PR-gene which paper mentions, though we don't look into that.

Is this the only factor driving differences between MCF7 and T47D, or are there more significant biological differences which are important?

================================
DRIVING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CELL LINES?
================================
What we can note: 
	1) The response is MUCH higher with respect to the number of genes in T47D
	2) Differential expression between cell lines show that a large amount of genes
		differ wrt their general expression level 
Most of these are conserved when you add progesterone -- so the cell lines really are quite different from each other.

================================
PATHWAY ANALYSIS
================================
Enriched pathways in T47D:
	Nothing interesting
Negatively enriched pathways:
	Splicing, transcription, chromatin stuff

================================
SHIT SLIDE
================================

================================
CAN ISOFORM LEVELS AFFECT THE DIFFERENCES?
================================

DEXSeq

Test groups

================================
Conclusion
================================
Effects seem to be largely PR related, but it's hard to judge.
