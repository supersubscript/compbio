- Lecture 1: Module Overview
------------------------------
How determine genome sequence of 10^9 bases when we can only read ca 500 bases
at a time?
  Chromosome, BACs, Tiling set, shotgun sequence + assembly -> contigs, assembly

Name two issues with whole genome shotgun method
  Cloning bias
  Assembly prone to mistakes (lots)

Describe the Mate-pairs method
  Mark both ends, link together circularly and shear
  Sequence inwards from new two ends. 

------------------------------
- Lecture 2: Next-gen sequencing
------------------------------

Roughly how many bases can Solexa sequence per run? Compare this to other
techniques.
  

How long does single-read solexa take?
  3h prep
  4 days DNA -> data
  Also says 8 days on other slide? 

How is a DNA library made?
  DNA-frag,emts -> blunting by fill-in and exonuclease -> Phosphorylation ->
  addition of A-overhang -> ligation to adapters

How many bases can Solexa sequence per run?
  ~300 Gbases

What is single molecule real-time sequencing?
  Shoot laser while sequencing. Find methylated bp???

Scoring using log-likelihood

What is BLOSUM?
  Score matrix based on prevalence of amino acids

------------------------------
- Lecture 3: Sequence alignment, part II
------------------------------

Dynamic programming

An alignment is a path through a finite state machine
Can also use dynamic programming for other types of alignments, i.e. gene
function

What can be done to improve efficiency in dynamic programming?
  We don't need to know all of the intron sequences, so we can cut away most of
    it. Piece together exons. 
  Banded genetic programming. Don't compute whole matrix.

Optimum tiling paths (Important!)
  Pick minimally overlapping set of sequence for scaffolding.
  Evaluate s = max_j |_j<i s_j q_i - g_ij
  Keep pointer to best element j, then traceback

What are the penalties in OTPs?
  Abut: 0, Greater overlap / gap -> higher penalty
  Gap cost > overlap cost
  Banding: don't consider seqs farther away than distance d

Explain BAC shotgun assembly
  100-150 kb long BAC clones
  Check for repeat content
  Pairwise alignment
  Assemble highest-scoring first
  Assemble repeat containing
  Paired-end important for contigs 
  Generate consensus
  Examine / edit / iterate

What is N50?
  The shortest sequence length at 50% of the genome
  Length = 54. Longest contigs = 10+9+8 = 27. => 8!

Describe the prokaryotic genome
  Circular, no introns, high gene density

What is in the human genome?
  95 % intergenic sequence
  Selfish DNA (transposons / retroviruses)

How much of the genokme is repetitive?
  50 %

What are CpG islands?
  C modified by methylation
  Frequently mutates to T
  CpG normally 5-fold underrepresented from genomic GC content in intergenic
  regions. More frequent where methylation is supressed.

What are transposons?
  DNA sequence which can change position within the genome. 

What can be done with repeats?
  Filtering, repeat masker
  Problem: false positive rate

What are problems with removing adapters?


------------------------------
- Lecture 6: Annotation
------------------------------
Definition of gene tricky

What types of genes are there?
  Protein coding
  Non-coding (structural or regulating)
  Pseudogenes

What is a pribnow box?
  Standard promoter sequence in prokaryotes

What is a TATA box?
  Often promoter sequence denoting motif. 24 % of all genes.

What is UTR?
  Untranslated region. Part of gene.
  5': Transcription start site; leader sequence. Hard to define.
  3': Contains poly-adenylation signal. 70 % of all pre-mRNAs contain AAUAAA.
  Target sequence for microRNAs. Also contain regulatory seqyebces for
  transcript stability or translation efficiency.

Explain splicing
  Tightly controlled. Donor / acceptor site consensus sequences are highly
  conserved between species.

How to find human genes?
  Human cDNA or EST sequences (EST: expressed sequence tag; short cDNA)
  Vertevrate cDNA or EST sequences
  Similarity in genome to known proteins
  Ab initio
  Combine predictions from multiple approaches

GeneWise. GenScan. Maker. SNAP.

What is a reading frame?
  Conversion of DNA-sequence into sets of triplets, coding for different amino
  acids. A shift in this shifts the whole sequence.

What is a frameshift mutation? 
  Mutation making nucleotides not divisible by three. Can alter the reading
  frame.

What are CEGs?
  Core Eukaryotic Genes. Required for eukar. life. 

tRNA
  Partial structure pred: quick, high FDR
  Full structure pred: slow, accurate

miRNA
  pre-miRNA forms stem-loop structure
  Conserved across species
  Homologous to target genes' 3' UTR
  Annotation visa sec. structure pred. 

Pseudogenes
  Often resembling (imperfect copies of) genes.
  May lack: complete ORF, functional splice sites, regulatory regions
  May be transcribed

How to find pseudogenes?
  Search for sequence sim. to known genes. Check for stop codons.
  Search for sim. to known protein structures (and contains stop)

Name some open issues in annotation
  Coding exon prediction -- accuracy
  Non-coding exon prediction
  polyA site prediction
  TF binding site identification
  Alternative splicing
  Pseudogenes
  Nested/overlapping genes
  Small structural RNA gens (e.g. miRNA)
  Replication origins.  

Describe the Tuxedo pipeline
  Tophat: align reads to genome (via bowtie)
  Cufflinks: assemble transcripts and calc. expression
  Cuffdiff: find DE
  CummeRbund: visualise

Explain what is wrong with the Minimum Path Cover Graph

What is the 30 % rule?

  BLAST: bidirectional best-hit

What is special about multiple alignment?
  Heuristic. 
  HMMs, e.g. HMMer

What is synteny?
  Recently diverged organisms have similar genetic codes (genes at same places)

What are Hox genes?
  Genes necessary for development.

Explain difference between homolog, ortholog, paralog
  Homo = {Ortho: between species; para: within species}

Alignment says something about evolutionary relationship

Tree building

33 % of gene expression changes between species.
