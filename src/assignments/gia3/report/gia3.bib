abstract="The HMG-box domain of {\textasciitilde}75 amino acid residues was originally identified as the domain that mediates the DNA-binding of chromatin-associated high-mobility group (HMG) proteins of the HMGB type. In the last few years, HMG-box domains have been found in various DNA-binding proteins including transcription factors and subunits of chromatin-remodeling complexes. HMG-box domains mediate either non-sequence-specific (e.g., HMGB-type proteins) or sequence-specific (e.g., transcription factors) DNA binding. Both types of HMG-box domains bind non-B-type DNA structures (bent, kinked and unwound) with high affinity. In addition, HMG-box domains are involved in a variety of protein-protein interactions. Here, we have examined the human and plant genomes for genes encoding HMG-box domains. Compared to plants, human cells contain a larger variety of HMG-box proteins. Whereas in humans transcription factors are the most divergent group of HMG-box proteins, in plants the chromosomal HMGB-type proteins are most variable.",

abstract="Therian mammals (marsupials and placentals) have an XX female: XY male sex chromosome system, which is homologous to autosomes in other vertebrates. The testis-determining gene, SRY, is conserved on the Y throughout therians, but is absent in other vertebrates, suggesting that the mammal system evolved about 310 million years ago (MYA). However, recent work on the basal monotreme mammals has completely changed our conception of how and when this change occurred. Platypus and echidna lack SRY, and the therian X and Y are represented by autosomes, implying that SRY evolved in therians after their divergence from monotremes only 166 MYA. Clues to the ancestral mechanism usurped by SRY in therians are provided by the monotremes, whose sex chromosomes are homologous to the ZW of birds. This suggests that the therian X and Y, and the SRY gene, evolved from an ancient bird-like sex chromosome system which predates the divergence of mammals and reptiles 310 MYA.",

pages="465",
abstract="SOX-9, an essential factor for male sexual development, can be induced by prostaglandin D2 in a Sry-independent mechanism. Recent data suggest that the hedgehog pathway is involved in the differentiation of normal Sertoli and Leydig cells. The purpose of our study was to investigate the mechanisms involved in the differentiation of ovarian sex cord-stromal tumour (SCST) cells. Two Sertoli--Leydig cell tumours and two granulosa cell tumours with a minor Sertoli element were studied using immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Sertoli cells expressed anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), SOX-9, prostaglandin D synthase (Pgds) and bcl-2 (in four of four cases); sonic hedgehog (Shh) and p53 (in three of four cases) and androgen receptors (AR; in one of four cases). Ki-67 index ranged from 10{\%} to 50{\%}. Leydig cells expressed Shh and AR (two of two cases), while they showed no expression of p53, bcl-2 and 0{\%} Ki-67 index. Granulosa cells expressed AMH, Pgds, Shh, estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, AR and bcl-2 (in two of two cases) and p53 (in one of two cases). Ki-67 index was 10{\%} and 40{\%}, respectively. Further investigation is required to clarify the role of the molecules outlined above in the histogenesis of ovarian SCST, as Pgds-mediated SOX-9 upregulation could provide a reasonable explanation for the presence of testicular differentiation in ovarian SCST.",
