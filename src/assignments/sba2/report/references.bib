abstract = {Molecular recognition in biological systems relies on the existence of specific attractive interactions between two part- ner molecules. Structure-based drug design seeks to identify and optimize such interactions between ligands and their host molecules, typically proteins, given their three-dimensional structures. This optimization process requires knowledge about interaction geometries and approximate affinity con- tributions of attractive interactions that can be gleaned from crystal structure and associated affinity data. Here we compile and review the literature on molecular interactions as it pertains to medicinal chemistry through a combination of careful statistical analysis of the large body of publicly availableX-ray structure data and experimental and theoretical studies of specific model systems. We attempt to extract key messages of practical value and complement references with our own searches of the CSDa,1 and PDB databases.2The focus is on direct contacts between ligand and protein functional groups, and we restrict ourselves to those interactions that are most frequent in medicinal chemistry applications. Examples from supramolecular chemistry and quantummechanical ormolecularmechanics calculations are cited where they illustrate a specific point. The application of automated design processes is not covered nor is design of physicochemical properties ofmolecules such as permeability or solubility.},
